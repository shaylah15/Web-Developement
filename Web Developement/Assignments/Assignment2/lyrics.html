<h5>ABOUT THE SONG</h5>
<p>"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)" is a song by new wave band Talking Heads, released in November 1983 as the second single from their fifth album Speaking in Tongues. The lyrics were written by David Byrne, and the music was written by Byrne and the other members of the band, Chris Frantz, Tina Weymouth and Jerry Harrison.
In the "Self Interview" on the DVD of the concert film Stop Making Sense, Byrne states that it is a love song, a topic he tends to avoid because it is "kinda big." He also said of the song:
That's a love song made up almost completely of non sequiturs, phrases that may have a strong emotional resonance but don't have any narrative qualities. It's a real honest kind of love song. I don't think I've ever done a real love song before. Mine always had a sort of reservation, or a twist. I tried to write one that wasn't corny, that didn't sound stupid or lame the way many do. I think I succeeded; I was pretty happy with that.[1]

    <p>[Verse 1]
    Home is where I want to be
    Pick me up and turn me round
    I feel numb, born with a weak heart
    I guess I must be having fun
    The less we say about it, the better
    Make it up as we go along
    Feet on the ground, head in the sky
    It's okay, I know nothing's wrong, nothing</p>
        <p>[Chorus]
            Hi-yeah, I got plenty of time
            Hi-yeah, you got light in your eyes
            And you're standing here beside me
            I love the passing of time
            Never for money, always for love
            Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight</p>
                <p>[Verse 2]
                    Home is where I want to be
                    But I guess I'm already there
                    I come home, she lifted up her wings
                    I guess that this must be the place
                    I can't tell one from the other
                    Did I find you or you find me?
                    There was a time before we were born
                    If someone asks, this is where I'll be, where I'll be
                    </p>
                        <p>[Chorus]
                            Hi-yeah, we drift in and out
                            Hi-yeah, sing into my mouth
                            Out of all those kinds of people
                            You got a face with a view
                            I'm just an animal looking for a home
                            Share the same space for a minute or two
                            And you love me 'til my heart stops
                            Love me 'til I'm dead
                            Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
                            Cover up the blank spots, hit me on the head, ah-ooh</p>
